# The-JESUS-token
A reflective-deflationary frictionless yield token built on Binance Smart Chain.

The $JESUS token combines the best
features of other passive yield tokens into
one smart token. The $JESUS token
removes the requirement to stake or lock
up your tokens on another website or
Dapp to receive rewards.
Simply holding $JESUS in a Binance Smart
Chain compatible wallet will see the
holders balance grow with every
transaction that takes place.
This removes the time and effort required
to ‘farm’ and ‘harvest’ tokens, and ensures
you maintain ownership of your coins
without having to give authorisation and
access to your wallet to external parties.

The $JESUS token contract applies a special
tax to every transaction,
whether it be a buy, sell, or trade.
With each transaction 6.2% is reflected
back to holders’ wallets, while 3.8% is
burned forever, reducing the total supply
over time. (Total tax is set to 10% and
can never exceed 10%, however the
proportion that is reflected or burned
can be adjusted from the current 6.2% &
3.8% ratio to best suit the $JESUS
ecosystem) $JESUS takes the best
elements of similar tokens and combines
them in order to create a unique passive
yield generation token.
